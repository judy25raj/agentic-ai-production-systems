### 🧠 Project 1 — Agentic AI: PDF RAG with Judge Agent

**Description**  
A modular Agentic AI system that performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on PDF documents and evaluates generated responses using a dedicated **Judge Agent**. The project demonstrates how multiple AI agents collaborate to retrieve context, generate answers, and assess response quality in a structured and repeatable workflow.

**Key Capabilities**
- Multi-agent workflow (Retriever → Generator → Judge)
- PDF ingestion and vector-based semantic search
- LLM-driven answer generation
- Automated evaluation and scoring
- Structured JSON outputs for traceability

### ☁️ Project 2 — Atomic Agent on Azure with Elastic Observability

**Description**  
A cloud-deployed atomic agent running on **Microsoft Azure** with centralized logging, metrics, and observability using the **Elastic Stack**. This project focuses on operational visibility, demonstrating how agent execution can be monitored, analyzed, and debugged in a production-style environment.

**Key Capabilities**
- Atomic agent execution model
- Azure VM–based deployment
- Centralized logging and metrics collection
- Observability dashboards and trace analysis
- Operational monitoring for distributed systems
